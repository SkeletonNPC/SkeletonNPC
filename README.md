- 👋 Hi, I’m @SkeletonNPC
-  I'm a free-lance coder who's very recluse and socially closed off. I pretty much hang out with my girlfriend, or am working. I'm a gamer too!
- 🌱 I'm currently learning better ways to script different tools to help streamline my production on a local level, but I am also assisting with a larger project called PS Home by Destination Home
- 💞️ Not looking to collaborate at the moment...
- 📫 You can hmu on discord if you'd like via ghost.ish_
- 😄 Pronouns: I'm a dude.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The first computer "bug" was a real bug! In 1947, engineers working on the Harvard Mark II computer found a moth trapped in a relay, causing the machine to malfunction. They removed the moth and taped it into the logbook, labeling it as the "first actual case of bug being found." This is where the term "debugging" comes from!
